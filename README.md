# Speed-Typing-Test-Website1
Developed a responsive website that allows users to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The site displays a random sentence, and as users type, it tracks the time taken and evaluates accuracy in real time. JavaScript was used for handling timers, user input events, DOM manipulation, and accuracy calculation logic.
